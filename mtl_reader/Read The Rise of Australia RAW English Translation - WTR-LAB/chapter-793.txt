Sometimes we have to admit that talent is the biggest factor that determines a person's ability.Although Szilard is only 34 years old, his ability is definitely not inferior to that of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and he is even definitely among the most capable physicists.According to Einstein's report, after Szilard joined the research and development of nuclear weapons, his unconstrained ideas created several solutions to previous problems, and indeed solved several problems that had troubled the project team for a long time.Not only did it speed up the development of nuclear weapons, it also gave the scientists in the research and development team more motivation.Because of this, with Arthur's permission, Einstein gave Szilard more responsibilities.After Szilard proved his abilities to other scientists in the R&D project team, Szilard was appointed deputy leader of the nuclear weapons R&D project team, and his main R&D area was changed to the construction of nuclear reactors.The reason why Arthur agreed to give Szilard such an important position was not only because he believed in his ability, but also because he hoped that he would be able to conceive of the nuclear chain reaction earlier in history and build the most basic nuclear reactor based on it.With nuclear reactors, it is equivalent to more than half of the research on nuclear weapons. Furthermore, as long as a nuclear reactor can be built, a nuclear power plant can be built accordingly, which will also be of great help to the laying of the power grid in Australasia.Australasia is vast and sparsely populated, and there is a large desert in central and western Australia, which is a good place to build a nuclear reactor.Especially when there are many small lakes in the desert, it can not only solve the refrigeration problem of the nuclear reactor, but also eliminate the need to worry about the leakage of the nuclear reactor in the event of special circumstances.This is much better than building nuclear reactors on the seaside. If it is built on the seaside, once the nuclear reactor leaks and a large amount of seawater pours into the nuclear reactor, a lot of nuclear sewage and nuclear wastewater will be produced.The treatment of this wastewater is also a big problem and will put a huge financial burden on the country.Of course, some countries do not have any quality and choose a method that everyone hates.As a country with a vast ocean, Australasia certainly wanted to prevent such a situation from occurring.The best outcome is to permanently eliminate the possibility of building nuclear reactors in this country. As for how to put an end to it, either eliminate this race, or let this country never become strong.Szilard's accelerated development of nuclear weapons also made Arthur attach great importance to the physicists who originally participated in the Manhattan Project.If the United States could collect so many physicists, Arthur believed Australasia could too.In particular, as chaos continues in various places and Australasia stabilizes, its attraction to immigrants from various countries is also increasing.Most of the physicists in the Manhattan Project were immigrants from foreign countries, which also proved the attraction of the United States to immigrants at that time.Now, Australasia has replaced the United States in terms of immigration, which also means that Australasia also has the ability to become the United States.What Arthur didn't expect was that such a conjecture would soon become a reality.Because of Australasia’s attractiveness in terms of immigration and the Victoria Award’s ability to attract top talents, it is no problem to attract some internationally renowned scientists every year.Among the new batch of famous scientists who immigrated to Australasia, Arthur soon discovered the historical figures who participated in the Manhattan Project.Enrico Fermi.This is a physicist from Italy who was elected as a member of the Royal Academy of Italy last year.So the question is, why did Enrico Fermi give up his title as a member of the Royal Academy in Italy, his position as a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Rome, and immigrate all the way to Australasia?This has to mention the laws enacted by Italy. Among anti-Semitic actions, people usually think of Germany's performance in World War II.But in fact, as a historical ally of Germany in World War II, Italy was very vigorous in anti-Semitic actions and even enacted quite stringent laws for this purpose.Unfortunately, Enrico Fermi's wife happened to be a prominent Jew, and she was a direct target of Italy's anti-Semitic laws.Although Enrico Fermi's title as a member of the Royal Academy came from Mussolini, this small title was unlikely to save Enrico Fermi's family amid the vigorous anti-Semitic actions in Italy.Because of this, Enrico Fermi chose to go to Australasia at its invitation.Less than a month after Szilard arrived in Australasia, Arthur welcomed another top physics talent to join the team.This is fantastic news for Australasia's nuclear programme.You know, Enrico Fermi's contribution to physics is no less than that of Szilard, and he was also an important member of the construction of the first nuclear reactor.Enrico Fermi is definitely one of the best researchers in the world today in his research on statistical mechanics, quantum theory, nuclear physics, and particle physics.For Arthur, Enrico Fermi's arrival also has good news, that is, he hopes to invite his teacher, Max Born, the famous German-Jewish theoretical physicist and one of the founders of quantum mechanics. .In fact, the reason is still the same. Whether it is Italy or Germany, their political systems are similar at this time.After Mussolini and Hitler took power, they began to oppose the Jews in quite tacit agreement.And many of those famous physicists are Jews. In other words, this is actually one of the real reasons why the United States was the first to develop the atomic bomb in history.It was precisely because of the persecution of Jewish scientists in Germany and Italy that these scientists fled to the United States, far away from Europe and away from the war.Of course, because the United States has been disbanded, the country far away from Europe and the war at this time has become Australasia.Max Born was not only a German-Jewish physicist, he was also a leading figure in quantum mechanics, lattice dynamics, fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamics and electromagnetic theory.More importantly, getting Max Born not only means getting a physics dean, but also means getting many famous scientists who have won the Nobel Prize in Physics in history.As a leading figure in physics, Max Born’s students can be said to be everywhere. In addition to Enrique Fermi, who has arrived in Australasia, there are several talents still based in Germany.Many of these talents are also Jewish, and they are also targets of Arthur's wooing.Thinking of this, Arthur still had some fluctuations in his already very mature heart. It can only be said that the relationship between European physicists is still relatively complex and close.As long as he can leverage a leading figure in physics, the connections he can use may bring dozens more top scientists to Australasia.Coupled with Australasia's own talent pool and attraction, it may be able to achieve even better results than the United States in history.Thinking of this, Arthur also decided to act in advance to avoid being caught first by the British.After Enrico Fermi arrived in Australasia, Arthur first organized a welcome banquet of the same size as Szilard, and then summoned Enrico Fermi the next day and invited him to join the Royal Academy of Australasia .Enrico Fermi was somewhat flattered by Arthur's personal interview and invitation.In Europe, Arthur is definitely a legend. Although the original Australian region was vast, in the eyes of the British it was a remote and barren area with only cattle, sheep and minerals.This kind of area, which may not even be as good as the European countryside, has become the third largest power in the world after Arthur's painstaking efforts for 30 years.Arthur has repeatedly emphasized the rights of the people and revised labor laws many times to safeguard the interests of the people at the bottom, which has made many European people have a high impression of him.Especially before Europe has fully implemented the eight-hour working system, Australasia has basically implemented the eight-hour working system, which makes many Europeans envious of Australasians.Enrico Fermi came from the Kingdom of Italy and had no objection to the monarchy.Of course, comparing the King of Italy and Arthur, Enrico Fermi instantly felt that there is still a big gap between people.On his first day in Australasia, Enrique Fermi did nothing.On the way from Sydney to Fort St. Arthur, Enrico Fermi observed the daily life of the Australasian people in detail and discovered the kind of bright smile that is simply not seen on the faces of Italians today.Speaking of which, Italy and Australasia are now also dictatorships. Even Arthur's autocratic power was much greater than that of Mussolini.But judging from the current situation of the two countries, the happiness index of the people in Australasia is several times that of the Italians. This is a true situation that cannot be concealed by any language or writing.Don't look at the fact that Mussolini implemented many reforms in Italy and expanded the army in an ambitious attempt to realize Italy's rejuvenation.But Mussolini's eyes had never seen the Italian civilians. What he cared about was his dictatorial power and the number of troops in his hands.However, due to the influence of the Renaissance, Italians are more artistic and romantic.Unlike the serious and rigid Germans, the cheerful and romantic Italians do not like war. They like a better life in peace.Obviously, the current rulers of Italy are destroying this kind of life, which is why Enrico Fermi feels that the happiness index of Italian people's lives is not high.More importantly, the military service policy implemented by Mussolini in Italy was compulsory conscription.Regardless of whether the Italian people are willing to join the army and go to the battlefield, they can only be forced to become active or reserve soldiers in the army.In this state, one can imagine the mood of the Italians. That is to say, the Italians really do not want to see a war, and Mussolini has carried out a large-scale purge of his opposition forces. Otherwise, it is not known whether the Italians will break out in rebellion.Based on these factors alone, Italy and Australasia are already destined to be very different.After actually meeting Arthur, Enrico Fermi felt that he was truly valued, not that Mussolini had other agendas.Although he also wanted Enrico Fermi to work for him, the importance shown by both parties had already determined Enrico Fermi's next choice.The second update of 3200 words, please vote for me and support!
