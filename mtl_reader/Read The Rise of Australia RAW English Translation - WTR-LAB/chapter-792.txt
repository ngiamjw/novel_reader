Chapter 763 Leo SzilardWhile Australasia and the United Kingdom are discussing how to control world oil prices, Germany, also located in Europe, does not seem so calm at this time.Italy, which had the same political system as his own, was currently engaged in a glorious colonial war, which made Hitler envious of Hitler who also wanted to expand his territory.But the problem was that Hitler, who had just become German Prime Minister, had not yet fully grasped power. The first thing he needs to do is to eliminate other political parties in Germany that oppose his rule, including previous government officials.Purging political parties and governments will certainly allow them to gain more power, but it will also allow other political parties to unite and launch counterattacks through private public opinion.Hitler first asked his men to submit a bill to Congress, which directly amplified the power of him and his party. They could even promulgate and amend the laws of the German Empire unscrupulously without passing it in Congress.This alone is comparable to Arthur's autocratic dictatorship in Australasia.But the problem is that Arthur's rule in Australasia is recognized by the people of Australasia, and Arthur has not used his own power to suppress other political parties and forces.But Hitler was different. After forcing Congress to pass this proposal, the next day he asked his subordinates to enact laws that severely suppressed other political parties, banned other political parties from giving speeches in Germany, and declared organized demonstrations illegal, which directly cut off the retreat of those political parties.As a result, other political parties will naturally stop doing it. In order to put enough pressure on Hitler to give up on implementing laws that suppressed other political parties, the political parties chose to unite and organized a very large demonstration.The scale of the march spread throughout Berlin, with at least 100,000 participants expected.The marchers shouted slogans against the dictatorship and demanded the maintenance of the legitimate power of the political parties, and passed the German Parliament with their heads held high.This move naturally caused dissatisfaction with Hitler and his men. There was a proposal to use armed force to suppress the demonstration, but Hitler ultimately rejected it.After all, the people marching were German people, and the scale was so large that it would be difficult to suppress them by force.Moreover, the use of force to suppress this demonstration will inevitably arouse more intense resistance from other political parties and the public.Compared with fighting for power in a short period of time, the stability of one's own rule is of course more important.Anyway, he has reached cooperation with William II. It will be a matter of time to ban the Congress. There is no need to rush this step.With this idea in mind, Hitler did not suppress the demonstration with force, but chose to divide it.For some originally neutral political parties, Hitler rewarded them with high-ranking officials and titles, attracting some political parties to join his own party and disintegrating the originally united opposition parties.Hitler was relatively decisive against those parties that firmly opposed him, and chose to use armed force to suppress these parties.Mentioned before. Hitler controlled more private armed forces than the German army. This armed force was also an important factor in easily eliminating other parties.Thanks to Hitler's efforts, the march only lasted a few days before it had to be stopped for various reasons.After the march stopped, Hitler took his next step, which was to directly declare other parties illegal.To be honest, as long as you control the government agencies and the army, you will be invincible in political struggles.This is the current Hitler. Not only does it control the government, it also controls an armed force that is far larger than the army.Under the cold threat of gunpoint, members of other parties were either assassinated or had to succumb to Hitler's rule.On August 3, 1930, Mustache declared all German parties except his own party illegal and started his own dictatorship.On August 5, he changed the name of his party's private armed forces to the SS, which also symbolized that his power had officially reached its peak.Faced with such a high-pressure dictatorship, many people in Germany still expressed dissatisfaction.This is actually a good opportunity for Arthur and Australasia. During this time, the number of immigrants from Germany increased significantly, and a significant number of them chose to come to Australasia.Among these immigrants, a large number of people attracted Arthur's attention. Arthur had previously ordered the intelligence department to pay special attention to Germany's more famous scientists, especially physicists and chemists.Following an intelligence investigation, Arthur was eventually provided with a list of German physical chemists who had immigrated to Australasia.The list is still very long, and there are many names that Arthur is not familiar with. However, among the many unknown names, Arthur soon discovered someone he was familiar with.One of the famous figures is Leo Szilard, whom Arthur is very much looking forward to.This name may be unfamiliar to many people, but his contribution to the development of nuclear weapons is no less than that of others who participated in the Manhattan Project.Leo Szilard was born on February 11, 1898, and is actually only in his early 32s now.Arthur had an impression of it because he only learned about it after searching for some famous scientists when he was inquiring about the Manhattan Project.Leo Szilard was born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and immigrated to Germany after the partition of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.As early as 1922, when Szilard was 24 years old, he received a doctorate from the Technical University of Berlin and already had a considerable reputation in physics.Australasia also tried to woo Leo Szilard at the time, but it ended in failure.The reason for the failure was that Szilard did not want to go to too much trouble. He preferred to live in Europe that he was familiar with, especially Germany and Austria.But after the situation in Germany entered chaos, Szilard was forced to emigrate.It is worth mentioning that the relationship between Szilard and Einstein is relatively good.Szilard met Einstein as early as when he was a student at the Technical University of Berlin, and the two became good friends.Now, when he learned that Szilard wanted to choose a place to immigrate to, Einstein recommended Australasia without even thinking about it, and invited Szilard to work with him.It is precisely because of this that the famous physicist Szilard brought his family to Australasia and chose to work with Einstein.To be honest, Szilard definitely contributed most to the promotion of atomic bomb research. Historically, on the eve of World War II, it was Szilard who tried his best to persuade Einstein to write to President Roosevelt, suggesting that the United States develop an atomic bomb before Germany, and also allowed the United States to launch the Manhattan Project.Most of the information Einstein gave to President Roosevelt was also drafted by Szilard.This letter is also called the Einstein-Szilard letter, symbolizing the two men's contribution to the Manhattan Project in the United States.The reason why Arthur looked forward to Szilard was because Szilard was not only a major member of the Manhattan Project, but also the first to conceive of the nuclear chain reaction, and based on this, he built the first nuclear reactor in American history.With Szilard in Australasia, there is no doubt that it will be able to speed up the construction of nuclear reactors and thereby promote the construction of atomic bombs.Because of this, Arthur still attaches great importance to Szilard. When he learned that Szilard and his party were about to arrive in Australasia, Arthur specially asked the very busy Einstein to spare half a day to greet his friends, and organized a meeting for Szilard at Fort St. Arthur. A welcome party.The people attending the welcome banquet were not dignitaries, but rather important scientists from the Royal Academy of Sciences.Arthur had no intention of being there in person. If they participate themselves, these scientists will be more restrained, which will make the banquet cold.The next day, Arthur met with Szilard in person and directly promised to let Szilard participate in the research of nuclear reactors.Arthur was not worried about Szilard's loyalty. Because all science involved in nuclear weapons research, he himself and all his family members must be monitored and controlled.As long as they participate in the research of nuclear weapons, they are not allowed to immigrate abroad until nuclear weapons are completely developed.Even entering and exiting the location of the research project must be reported, which most likely eliminates the possibility of other countries sending spies.To be honest, the area where the nuclear weapons research and development project team is located is the most heavily guarded area in Australasia, except for the royal palace.If this can be infiltrated by foreign spies, then Arthur should also consider the loyalty and capabilities of the intelligence organization.Moreover, in order to maintain the confidentiality of nuclear weapons research and development, all three intelligence agencies have sent their own main forces, and there will be no contact between the three intelligence agencies.This also greatly rejects the negligence of intelligence work. Once there is a problem in intelligence work, one of the three intelligence agencies will always find it and report it.As for Szilard's salary, it is definitely impossible to increase it to the same level as Einstein at the beginning.Fortunately, Szilard also understood this. Coupled with the fact that he can work with his friend Einstein, he does not have much requirements for salary and benefits, as long as his family can live an ordinary life.In order to reflect his emphasis on talents, Szilard's family was arranged to live in Melbourne and given them a single-family villa and a car.Of course, this also makes it easier for the Intelligence Agency to monitor Szilard's family. Before nuclear weapons are developed, or before Arthur trusts Szilard enough, certain surveillance and preparedness are still necessary.After all, it is necessary to be on guard against others, not to mention a scientist who has just immigrated to Australasia from a foreign country and has already participated in the country's most important research and development project.The first update of 3000 words, please vote for me and support!
