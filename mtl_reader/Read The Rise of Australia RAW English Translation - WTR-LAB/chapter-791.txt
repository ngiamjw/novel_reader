Once the technical worker position hierarchy and minimum wage guarantee policies were released, they caused a huge response in the country.Of course, the impact is mostly positive. People still welcome such job levels because they can indeed increase their salary levels.In particular, some workers who think their abilities are pretty good have planned to take the Level 4 Worker Certificate after the construction of the technical assessment point in their area is completed, and obtain the highest salary level among skilled workers.However, the reality is not as ideal as they thought. The assessment of technical workers is done step by step. This also means that they must start with the first-level technical workers until they reach the fourth-level technical workers.Knowing that the response from the public was relatively positive, Arthur no longer paid attention to the subsequent grading and assessment.After all, these can be accomplished by the cabinet government alone. If Arthur pays attention, it will put more pressure on them.At present, Arthur is more concerned about how to find ways to generate income for the government and the royal family.Of course, it is the government that needs to increase revenue the most. Although the royal family's income is not as high as that of the government, it also has much less money to spend than the government.Although the government's revenue is large, it has to take care of the livelihood of more than 30 million people in the entire kingdom. Such expenditures are not huge.The royal family currently only has a few people to spare, and no matter how much they squander, their annual income is completely sufficient.Of course, under Arthur's order and control, the royal family members have not behaved too extravagantly so far.Arthur set a rule for the Australasian royal family: all royal members can receive a gift from the royal consortium when they reach adulthood.This gift may be a factory, a business, or some mineral resources and items of equal value, etc.The only adults currently are William and Anna. William's gift was a rubber company worth almost $3 million at the time.After taking action at the highest point, William invested all the cashed-out funds into the rubber industry in Java.At present, the total market value of the rubber company controlled by William has exceeded 10 million Australian dollars, and the annual profit exceeds 2 million Australian dollars. He can be regarded as a proper multi-millionaire.The gift Arthur gave to Anna was actually a business. Of course, in line with the principle of raising a poor child and a rich daughter, Arthur actually favored Anna more.The Saxe-Coburg-Gotha watch company mentioned earlier had a luxury goods factory called Victoria Jewelry, which was given to Anna by Arthur.This luxury goods factory mainly produces a variety of precious jewelry, necklaces, earrings, etc., including dedicated women's watches.The market value at that time was almost 4 million Australian dollars, and now it exceeds 10 million Australian dollars.Of course, the surge in the market value of this luxury goods factory is largely due to the depreciation of the Australian dollar, rather than Anna's business layout.In terms of business, Anna obviously doesn't have much interest. If Anna hadn't loved jewelry and watches, Arthur wouldn't have gifted her this luxury company.But having said that, the biggest reason why Arthur gave William a rubber company to operate on his own was because he wanted to test William's business abilities.In fact, the bigger reason for gifting Anna this luxury company is the rain and dew and the love for Anna.Even if this luxury goods company goes bankrupt, Arthur can always start another company with the same market value and give it to Anna for various reasons.Back to business. How can the government increase fiscal revenue?In addition to the efforts of the state, the fastest and most effective way is to enable those companies with state-owned shares to expand rapidly or earn more benefits.After thinking for a long time, Arthur still looked at the Persian Gulf. There are huge oil fields of immeasurable value, and it is also an area that can quickly generate large amounts of profits.When it comes to oil fields, we have to mention the current world oil prices.After so many years of development, cars have already become a necessity in people's daily lives.Nowadays, horses are rarely seen in more advanced cities. After all, cars are faster, more stable and more comfortable than horses.Moreover, horses will involuntarily excrete in the city, which will destroy the beauty and hygiene of the city. It is also one of the reasons why horses are banned in big cities.Cars are different. Although cars also emit exhaust gas, the gas will float into the sky after all, and it will not have much impact on the beauty and cleanliness of the city.Of course, the current public does not know the dangers of automobile exhaust. Moreover, factories and businesses outside cities emit large amounts of exhaust gas, which is much more serious than car exhaust.If you are in a city like London, you will basically not see car exhaust. After all, the smog in London is much more serious than the exhaust fumes. The color of the smog has already overshadowed the car exhaust fumes.Precisely because the car ownership rate continues to rise, international oil prices are currently rising steadily.As of July 1930, international oil prices were almost five times what they were before World War I and 11 times what they were in 1900, which is enough to show the horror of rising oil prices.Although it has experienced ups and downs, oil prices have grown steadily most of the time.But having said that, although exporting oil makes money, there are limits to how much money can be earned.Only by truly controlling the price of oil and being able to control the price within the range you want can you truly earn enough profits.Australasia currently controls a considerable part of the Persian Gulf coast, and actually already has the capital to control world oil prices.But the problem is that another giant in the Persian Gulf is the United Kingdom, and the British also have a large number of colonies in the Persian Gulf.If Australasia begins to control world oil prices, the British will certainly be looking for trouble.After all, Britain does not want to see Australasia earn a lot of money from oil and then invest it in national development and military to overtake Britain.In this case, the best result is to jointly control the world oil price with the British and achieve mutual prosperity in oil.Speaking of which, the Persian Gulf region jointly controlled by Britain and Australasia accounts for more than 60% of the world's oil reserves.What's more, there are still a large number of oil fields that have not been discovered, and the proportion may be higher at this time.As long as Britain and Australasia can unite, controlling world oil prices will not be a problem at all.This not only allows them to earn large profits through changes in oil prices, but also affects countries that rely on exporting oil for a living and weakens their competitors.Thinking of this, Arthur also decided to take action.Only by completely controlling the price of oil can we earn more profits in the future during World War II.Which of the aircraft and tanks in World War II did not require oil? It is no exaggeration to say that with the research in the field of engines, countries around the world are now inseparable from oil, an important energy source.As long as Australasia and Britain can control world oil prices, the future World War II will be a great opportunity for Australasia to search for European assets.It can also be seen from the map that the Persian Gulf is still very close to Europe. It only needs to enter the Indian Ocean and then enter the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal to transport oil to European countries along the Mediterranean coast.The short distance has a price advantage, which also means that Australasia hopes to become Europe's oil supplier in World War II, which may be tens or even tens of billions of Australian dollars in profits.European countries cannot provide money and do not need money. They can exchange it with various resources, talents, industrial facilities and machinery, or even make an IOU.As long as it controls a large amount of debt of European countries, Australasia's influence on Europe will continue to strengthen after World War II.This is just like World War I. In the First World War in history, the Americans also held this idea and finally realized their plan to become the world's hegemon.Even Americans of this era had such ambitions in World War I, and even did not hesitate to provide funds to the Allies to join the war.But it is a pity that due to the addition of Australasia at that time, the First World War ended early, and the Americans did not gain much benefit.If the United States is allowed to reap benefits, I am afraid it will not be so easy to solve the United States after World War I.After all, the biggest change brought to the United States before and after World War I in history was that the United States changed from a debtor country to a moneylender country.Negotiating international oil prices was naturally left to the ambassador to the UK and the European royal family chief.Britain and Australasia can set relevant oil price standards and control the rise and fall of oil prices through the oil they control along the Persian Gulf coast.Even if there is a certain amount of speculation, the price of oil can increase several times at an exaggerated speed, and the profits will also increase several times.How to operate it depends on the outcome of the discussions between the two countries. After all, the price of oil is also related to the people's livelihood of the country. If you want to speculate in oil unscrupulously, it depends on whether the domestic people agree.According to the current international oil prices, the price of a barrel of crude oil is approximately A$5.7. At the peak of the world war, the price of crude oil rose to 3.4 pounds per barrel, which is about 6.8 Australian dollars.However, the current currency has depreciated. Although it seems that the current crude oil price is close to the peak of the world war, it is actually less than half of that time.According to Arthur's estimation, if the negotiations with the British go smoothly, the price of crude oil can increase to 6 to 7 Australian dollars.Don’t underestimate this increase of 1 or 2 Australian dollars, which may bring profits of millions or even tens of millions of Australian dollars.After all, the export of crude oil is not a small figure. The cumulative consumption of crude oil in any country is definitely a huge number, and the increase in profits is definitely exaggerated.The second update of 3000 words, please vote for me and support!
