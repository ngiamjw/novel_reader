It was already the second day when Arthur met with Enrico Fermi.To be honest, Arthur is still very curious about this famous physicist who is famous in history.Speaking of Enrico Fermi's name and honor, it is really a famous one."One of the greatest scientists of the 20th century", "the last all-round talent in the scientific community of the 20th century", "the father of the world's atomic energy" and "the father of neutron physics" are not only praises for Fermi by later generations, but also represent this man. The scientist who is currently only 29 years old, what achievements has he created in history?Szilard and Fermi, two scientists who became famous at a young age and achieved high achievements, actually proved that in some aspects, people's achievements are already destined by their talent.Looking at Fermi who was not too reserved in front of him, Arthur smiled and asked: "Dr. Fermi, what do you think of Australasia?""It's very good." Fermi praised sincerely: "I originally thought that Sydney might not be as good as Rome, but now I find that Italy is really lagging behind.Australasians are very happy, which is something that Italy currently cannot achieve. "A year ago, Fermi would not have been so dissatisfied with Mussolini. Even because Mussolini awarded Fermi the title of academician of the Royal Academy, Fermi had a good impression.But with the outbreak of war between Italy and the Abyssinian Empire, coupled with the anti-Semitic laws promulgated by Mussolini, Fermi began to think about the shortcomings of Italian rule.Comparing it with today's Australasia, Fermi discovered that it was not the dictatorship that was wrong, but the person who implemented the dictatorship.It doesn't matter whether the political system is good or bad. Monarchy can also make a country prosperous and strong.What really determines the development of a country is the person who controls the power of the country. The person who currently controls the power of the Kingdom of Italy is, of course, Mussolini, known as the dictator.Regarding the rule and management of their respective countries by Mussolini and Arthur, Fermi could only say that he was glad that he left Italy early.Hearing Fermi's slightly sincere admiration, Arthur nodded calmly, and then went straight to the topic: "Dr. Fermi, on behalf of the Royal Australasian Academy of Sciences, I formally invite you to become an academician of the Academy of Sciences. I wonder if you are willing to accept it? ""This is my honor, Your Majesty." Femi nodded and directly agreed to Arthur's invitation.The Royal Academy of Australasia and the Royal Academy of Italy are actually of the same nature, equivalent to the highest honor in a country's scientific community.Although Fermi was already an academician of the Royal Academy of Italy, he was new to Australasia, and he never thought that he would be able to directly enter the Royal Academy of Sciences.At present, it seems that the statement circulated in Europe that Arthur attaches great importance to talents is true, and he has indeed given himself enough respect.Arthur was definitely generous enough for Fermi, who was famous and capable.After hearing that Femi agreed to his invitation, Arthur turned around and asked the guard to hand over a signing contract.This contract not only stated the invitation for Fermi to become an academician of the Royal Academy of Sciences, but also included the treatment and benefits that Fermi could enjoy.First of all, after voting by the Royal Academy of Sciences, the treatment that Fermi can enjoy starts directly from the level of second-level academician, skipping the levels of expert and first-level academician.Further up is the pinnacle of academicians, which is the third-level academician. Theoretically speaking, third-level academicians are the pinnacle of all ordinary scientists.Because the higher-level affiliated hospital and dean's treatment can only be obtained by creating enough honors and contributions to the Royal Academy of Sciences.Of course, if Fermi successfully participated and made a considerable contribution to the research of nuclear weapons, it would be very simple for him to receive the treatment of Honorary Vice President or Vice President based on his merit.It is worth mentioning that although there are more than 1,000 scientists in the Royal Academy of Sciences, the largest number are experts and first-class academicians.There is a dividing line between first-level academicians and second-level academicians, which is also the gap between ordinary talents and outstanding talents.As a famous talent in physics, Arthur certainly would not waste Fermi's ability in physics.In addition to serving as a second-level academician of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Fermi will also serve as an honorary professor of physics at the Australian-Canadian University and the Royal Academy of Sciences.After that, it is more conventional, a property and a car that every talent can enjoy.Although this is relatively routine, the actual value is very high. Judging from the current house prices and car sales in Australasia, the total value of these two items is close to 1,200 Australian dollars.After all, the properties donated by the royal family are all single-family villas located in the prosperous area of ​​St. Arthur's Castle in the capital.With the construction and development of St. Arthur's Castle, the value of these properties will become higher and higher, which can be regarded as a disguised investment.If Arthur remembers correctly, the house price in Sydney, which was first given to the scientists of the Royal Academy of Sciences, has now increased by more than ten times.If Arthur had not deliberately suppressed the growth of real estate prices in Australasia, I am afraid that the prices of those single-family villas would have skyrocketed, even reaching sky-high prices that are simply beyond the reach of ordinary people.At present, house prices in Australasia are quite normal and definitely not beyond the reach of ordinary people.The per capita income is about 142 Australian dollars per year, and the average urban housing price in the three major cities is about 550 Australian dollars.This means that a family of three can basically afford a house after two years of struggle.Moreover, when it comes to buying a house, the government also has considerable preferential and subsidy policies.Families with two children can enjoy a 10% home purchase subsidy and even a two-year mortgage interest exemption.On this basis, for every additional child born, the home purchase subsidy will be increased by 10%, and the mortgage interest exemption will be extended for two years.As long as you have four children, you can enjoy a maximum 30% home purchase subsidy and a preferential policy of mortgage interest exemption.This kind of discount is still very exaggerated. The house price can be reduced to a maximum of 385 Australian dollars, which is already close to the house price in the suburbs.Because of such favorable preferential and subsidy policies, people are still happy to have children.Moreover, for families with multiple children, the government will provide additional financial subsidies and even various support policies, so that families with multiple children do not have too much burden.There have been many news reports in Australasia proving that having four children is the best choice. You can enjoy the lowest house prices and lowest taxes, and the expenses are not much different from those of families with three children.Because of this, many couples in Australasia are currently choosing to have four children.In this era when entertainment facilities and projects are relatively scarce, the fun of having a baby is indeed greater than some seemingly boring entertainment.People are happy to have children, which is one of the real reasons for Australasia's growing population.Speaking of which, the population of Australasia is only over 30 million, and the number of births to the native population every year exceeds 500,000. This is actually a considerable number.Moreover, the number of births of the local population is also constantly increasing. One day, the annual number of births of the local population alone may exceed 1 million.After a cursory glance at the conditions offered by Arthur, Fermi was a little surprised for a moment.This condition is much more generous than what Mussolini offered, and it can be said that it is full of sincerity.If Arthur really offered such conditions to every talent, then it would be natural for Australasia to develop so rapidly.After confirming that there were no problems, Fermi decisively signed his name and joined the Royal Australasian Academy of Sciences.After seeing Fermi sign his name, Arthur smiled and nodded, and said: "Academician Fermi, I currently have two plans for your research direction.One, join a top-secret project underway in Australasia. This project is related to the future development of Australasia and is a top-secret project with the highest priority.It can be said that this project is very difficult and highly confidential. But once the project is completed, it will be very important to the country, and all scientific researchers participating in the project will receive sufficient rewards.In addition, you can also choose to set up your own laboratory and select physics projects that the Royal Academy of Sciences is going to study.But the construction of the laboratory will take some time. Before the construction of the laboratory is completed, you may have to work in the laboratory of your national university to conduct research, and at the same time, you may work part-time as a physics professor at the national university. "Although Arthur expected Fermi to join the research of nuclear weapons, he could not force these scientists after all.Whether you join the research on nuclear weapons or engage in other physics research, you are actually conducting research for Australasia, and there is not much difference.Letting Fermi choose his own career direction was also the greatest respect Arthur gave him. Arthur's purpose was also very simple, to let Fermi completely recognize himself and this country, and then, through Fermi, invite his teacher Max Born and his Several brothers.Regarding the two plans proposed by Arthur, Fermi also understood that they were his two best options at the moment.There is actually nothing to choose between these two options. For talents like Fermi who have shown physical talent from the beginning, challenge is what they are looking forward to.What's more, although he didn't know what the top-secret project Arthur was talking about was, through yesterday's welcome banquet, Fermi still knew that guys like Einstein and Szilard were working on this top-secret project.In this case, Fermi still finds it more interesting to enter this top-secret project and show off his talents and abilities.In addition to letting Arthur understand that his attention is not given to the wrong person, he also needs to challenge himself and give his boring scientific career a little fun."Your Majesty, I am willing to join the research of top-secret projects." Fermi said: "I am very curious about what kind of top-secret projects will attract so many scientists to join.If I could, I could get to work right now.
